# Frontend Mentor - Four card feature section solution

Hi! This is my solution to the [Four card feature section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/four-card-feature-section-weK1eFYK). I tried to complete this challenge using only the references from the resources and my intuition to determine aspects like padding and border-radius.

## Overview

### Screenshot

This is an example of the component in a "desktop" resolution.

As you can see, the component looks good in mobile resolutions. In this example, the width resolution was set to 375px.

## My process

I am not an expert in designing components, but my process was the following:

1. I created the HTML elements as suggested by Frontend Mentor.
2. Then, I added the style.css sheet.
3. I like to work with variables, so I defined the main variables of my project where I put the colors in hex.
4. After that, I defined the "global aspect" of my project. As I like to work with rem, where 1rem = 10px, I set the font-size in the html to 62.5%.
5. Then, I created the CSS for the component.
6. Finally, I made the media querys for differents screens.

This time I tried to use the "mobile-first" approach to do something different. I usually put the image in a div and then change the size of this div like a cut mask, but I wanted to try something different.

### Built with
